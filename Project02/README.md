# CS1XA3 Project 02 - bandukwn



## Overview
#### This webpage is Nida Bandukwala's CV/Resume. 

The main page of my website states my name and current occupation. The buttons at the top of the page are to help the user navigate the website. The "About" button redirects you to the "About Me" section of the website in which I give a little introduction about myself. The "Work and Projects" button redirects the user to the part of the website which describes my work experience and relevant projects. The "Skills" button takes the user to the skills section which lists my hard and soft skills. The buttons "Education" and "Certificates" will take the user to the part of the website which lists my academic qualifications and non-academic certificates respectively. Finally, the "Contact" button will give the user information on how to contact me. 

#### Important Note: This website should be opened on a Chrome browser for animation purposes.
